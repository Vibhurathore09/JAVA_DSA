Brackets Balanced

        For a given a string expression containing only round brackets or parentheses,
        check if they are balanced or not. Brackets are said to be balanced if the bracket
         which opens last, closes first.
        Example:
        Expression: (()())
        Since all the opening brackets have their corresponding closing brackets, we say it
        is balanced and hence the output will be, 'true'.
        You need to return a boolean value indicating whether the expression is balanced or not.
        Note:
        The input expression will not contain spaces in between.
        Input Format:
        The first and the only line of input contains a string expression without any spaces in between.
        Output Format:
        The only line of output prints 'true' or 'false'.
        Note:
        You don't have to print anything explicitly. It has been taken care of. Just implement the function.
        Constraints:
        1 <= N <= 10^7
        Where N is the length of the expression.

        Time Limit: 1sec
        Sample Input 1 :
        (()()())
        Sample Output 1 :
        true
        Sample Input 2 :
        ()()(()
        Sample Output 2 :
        false
        Explanation to Sample Input 2:
        The initial two pairs of brackets are balanced. But when you see, the opening bracket at
         the fourth index doesn't have its corresponding closing bracket which makes it imbalanced and in turn,
         making the whole expression imbalanced. Hence the output prints 'false'.*/
